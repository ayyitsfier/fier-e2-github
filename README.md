This is a very simple collection of Expression 2 chips that I'd like to release to the public. You are free to use these chips however you'd like but I do wish you include a link to this GitHub and/or some sort of other credit towards me. All of the work featured on this GitHub is my original work and I've spent quite a bit of time working, designing, and perfecting these chips.

Feel free to reverse engineer these and use them to learn to do something with Expression 2, or use them to learn what not to do when you compare other chips to mine.

I'm not saying the way I made these were the best and have no doubt that someone else has created something I have decided to develop in my way in a better way.
